# Food QA system

This is a QA system that was designed to answer questions about food (in a broadest sense) that can be found in [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page). In practice, it will be able to answer questions about other domains as well. It was not designed to give a correct answer, not a quick answers.

This was our entry for the final project of the [Language Technology practical](https://www.rug.nl/ocasys/feb/vak/show?code=KIB.PTT07) course of the University of Groningen. It was able to answer the highest number of questions correctly of all participating teams.

## Sample questions

```
1	Where does pasta come from?
2	Which material is used for producing dog food?
3	What is meat?
4	Is barbecuing considered a cooking technique?
5	List the main ingredients of bread
6	What is the country of origin of apple pie?
7	What is the E number of citric acid?
8	Who founded McDonald's?
9	Name the mass of a baguette
10	Is goat milk healthy?
11	What color grapes are there?
12	Give a list of Indian Food
13	How many ingredients does ratatouille have?
```
